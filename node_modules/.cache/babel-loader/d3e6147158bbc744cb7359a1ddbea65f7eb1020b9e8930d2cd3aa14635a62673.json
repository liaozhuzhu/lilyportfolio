The takeovers were designed to showcase the breadth of opportunities Tippie students have and to provide a platform for students to share their experiences and perspectives. \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    The takeovers featured 22 total students from a variety of backgrounds and majors, and each takeover consisted of a series of Instagram stories that were posted over the course of a day, detailing aspects of their everyday routine or overall experience.  \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    This project was my main task during the intial summer portion of my internship. I reached out to all potential students, facilitated brainstorming meetings with each student, scheduled the content on Tippieâ€™s content calendar, wrote each caption, aggregated all content and information to post the stories and feed photos for each student, and finally managed the Instagram account after posting.  \n                </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"experience-project container-flex\">\n                <div class=\"project-box container-flex\">\n                    <div class=\"takeover-grid\">\n                        <div class=\"takeover-box\" v-for=\"takeover in takeovers\" :key=\"takeover.src\">\n                            <a :href=\"takeover.href\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                <img :src=\"require(`../static/summer-takeovers/${takeover.src}`)\"/>\n                            </a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                <div class=\"project-box container-flex project-details\">\n                    <h1 class=\"project-title\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tippiecollege/\" target=\"_blank\">Student Summer Takeovers 2022</a></h1>\n\n                    <p class=\"project-desc\">\n                    Here are a handful of the takeovers I directed!
