This day provides a unique opportunity to promote the importance of cultural diversity and the significance of language as a means of communication, specifically within business.  \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    Ideated during the summer portion of my internship, this project stems from my passion for world languages, cultures, and linguistics. As someone who is involved in a lot of the cultural organizations within Tippie, I realized how amazing students who are attending classes, completing homework, and connecting with others in English, despite their native language being completely different. Itâ€™s truly a superpower that most native English speakers do not recognize or appreciate.  \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    Since this video is my own passion project, my supervisors gave me full responsibility to execute the idea. I coordinated the filming, recorded the footage, and edited the footage into the final video. \n                </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"experience-project container-flex\">\n                <div class=\"project-box container-flex\">\n                    <video-player\n                        class=\"experience-video\"\n                        src=\"./assets/tippie-intern/motherlanguage/motherlanguage.mp4\"\n                        poster=\"./assets/tippie-intern/motherlanguage/thumbnail.png\"\n                        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n                        playsinline\n                        controls\n                        :loop=\"false\"\n                        :volume=\"0.6\"\n                        :playback-rates=\"[0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\"\n                        @mounted=\"handleMounted\"\n                        @ready=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @play=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @pause=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @ended=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @loadeddata=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @waiting=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @playing=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @canplay=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @canplaythrough=\"handleEvent($event)\"\n                        @timeupdate=\"handleEvent(player?.currentTime())\"\n                    />\n                </div>\n                \n                <div class=\"project-box container-flex project-details\">\n                    <h1 class=\"project-title\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Co79nhyDYfF/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Tippie International Mother Language Day</a></h1>\n\n                    <p class=\"project-desc\">\n                    \"Business is Global\"\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    Link to original post: <a class=\"desc-link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Co79nhyDYfF/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/p/Co79nhyDYfF/?hl=en</a>\n                    </p>\n                    \n                    <p class=\"project-date\">02/21/2023</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>     \n    </div>\n</template>\n  \n<script>\nexport default {\n    name: \"MotherLanguageVue\",\n    created() {\n        document.title=\"International Mother Language Day | Lily Dosedel\"\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
