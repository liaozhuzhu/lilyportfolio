                    International Mother Language Day is a global observance that celebrates linguistic and cultural diversity around the world. This day provides a unique opportunity to promote the importance of cultural diversity and the significance of language as a means of communication, specifically within business.

                    Ideated during the summer portion of my internship, this project stems from my passion for world languages, cultures, and linguistics. As someone who is involved in a lot of the cultural organizations within Tippie, I realized how amazing students who are attending classes, completing homework, and connecting with others in English, despite their native language being completely different. Itâ€™s truly a superpower that most native English speakers do not recognize or appreciate.

                    Since this video is my own passion project, my supervisors gave me full responsibility to execute the idea. I coordinated the filming, recorded the footage, and edited the footage into the final video.
